    <h1>CSS Combinators</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      Combinators define the relationship between two or more selectors in CSS.
    </p>

    <!-- Descendant Combinator -->
    <section>
      <h2>Descendant Combinator (space)</h2>
      <div class="descendant">
        <p>This paragraph is a descendant of the div.</p>
        <section>
          <p>This nested paragraph is also a descendant of the div.</p>
        </section>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Child Combinator -->
    <section>
      <h2>Child Combinator (&gt;)</h2>
      <div class="child">
        <p>This paragraph is a direct child of the div.</p>
        <section>
          <p>
            This paragraph is <strong>not</strong> a direct child, so it won't
            match.
          </p>
        </section>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Next Sibling Combinator -->
    <section>
      <h2>Next Sibling Combinator (+)</h2>
      <div class="sibling1">I am a div</div>
      <p>This paragraph is immediately after the div and will be selected.</p>
      <p>
        This paragraph is not immediately after a div, so it won't match with +
        combinator.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Subsequent-Sibling Combinator -->
    <section>
      <h2>Subsequent-Sibling Combinator (~)</h2>
      <div class="subsequent">I am a div</div>
      <p>
        This paragraph is a subsequent sibling of the div and will be selected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another paragraph following the div; also selected with ~ combinator.
      </p>
    </section>
